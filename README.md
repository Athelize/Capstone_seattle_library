# Seattle Public Library Checkouts Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze the checkout data from the Seattle Public Library to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted readership trends. The analysis focuses on changes in readership patterns, popular book titles, the shift from physical books to ebooks, and genre preferences. It will compare data from the two years before the pandemic to the pandemic period and beyond, and will look to investigate the readership trends of the visitors to the Seattle Public Library.

## Motivation
As a lifelong book enthusiast, I have a deep passion for reading and its societal impact. In an age where technology competes for our attention, I am curious to explore whether the pandemic, with its increased free time and digital options, influenced the reading habits of the community. Did more time at home lead to higher readership? Did the availability of ebooks change the popularity of specific titles? This project seeks to answer these questions.

## Data Questions
How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect checkouts at the Seattle Public Library? 
I will analyze trends leading up to the pandemic, compare them with the pandemic period, and explore the post-pandemic situation in 2023.
